                        <p>
                            These terms and conditions (the "Terms") govern your use of your Gift Card. Please take the time to read and understand these Terms before using your Gift Card. We also recommend keeping a copy of the Terms for future reference. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Gift Card. <br>

                            1. The Gift Card is issued and operated by The Great British Pub Card, Mulgrave Farm Guisborough Road, Ugthorpe, Whitby, England, YO21 2BE <br>

                            2. The Gift Card allows you to upload a cash value onto your Gift Card which can be used to pay for Greene King products and services. The money loaded onto your Gift Card is only a pre-payment system for the goods and services of participating Greene King pubs, restaurants and hotels; it is not a credit card, credit line or deposit account. No interest, dividends or any other earnings will accrue on the money loaded onto your Gift Card. Greene King will provide a physical gift card or e-gift card to the value of money uploaded.
                            <br>
                            3. To activate and upload money onto your Gift Card, you must be aged 18 or over and a resident in the UK. The Gift Card can be used by UK residents aged 14 or over, but the purchase of certain products and services are subject to age requirements specified by law.
                            <br>
                            4. The card can be loaded with any value between £5 and £250.  The maximum value which may be stored on a Gift Card purchased by you is £250. Gift Cards can only be topped-up at a Greene King site.
                            <br>
                            5. Gift Cards purchased online will be sent to the delivery address stated on each individual order and will be dispatched on receipt of cleared funds. If payment is not received your order will be cancelled.
                            <br>
                            6. If you have purchased the Gift Card through a third party, additional terms and conditions may apply and you should refer directly to that third party for further information.
                            <br>
                            7. The monetary value on your Gift Card can be used as full or part payment for Greene King products and services at any participating Greene King site in England, Scotland and Wales. When you use your Gift Card, the cash balance on your Gift Card will be reduced by the full cash value of your Greene King purchase. You can check your account balance online here. We reserve the right to correct or amend the remaining balance in your account if we believe that an invoicing or accounting error has occurred. If you wish to contest such a correction or amendment to your account balance, please call 01709 242099.
                            <br>
                            8. You must be present with your Gift Card when you make purchases at a Greene King site.
                            <br>
                            9. The money uploaded to your Gift Card cannot be exchanged for cash or refunded to your credit card or debit card. Any remaining balance will be stored on the Gift Card and may be used to pay, in whole or in part, for future purchases at Greene King sites.
                            <br>
                            10. All money uploaded on your Gift Card will expire 12 months from activation. Any balance left on the Gift Card after this date will be forfeited and cannot be refunded.
                            <br>
                            11. You should treat your Gift Card as cash for any purchases at participating Greene King sites. You are responsible for any unauthorised payments using your Gift Card. Therefore please do not allow others to use your Gift Card. Greene King is not liable for lost, stolen or damaged Gift Cards.
                            <br>
                            12. Gift Cards may not be sold, exchanged or used for any other purpose, except as specified in these Terms, without Greene King’s prior written permission.
                            <br>
                            13. Greene King does not warrant or represent that your Gift Card will always be accepted at participating Greene King sites. For example, in the unlikely event of a failure of Greene King IT and communications systems, Greene King may not be able to accept Gift Cards as payment during such a system failure.
                            <br>
                            14. Greene King reserves the right to refuse to accept a Gift Card or to limit the use of a Gift Card which it deems to have been tampered with, duplicated, damaged or which otherwise is suspected to be affected by fraud, misconduct or unauthorised use. Greene King may withdraw or cancel your Gift Card or take any other action it may deem appropriate if it suspects fraud, misconduct or unauthorised use of your Gift Card. The Gift Card shall become invalid once cancelled and you will not be able to redeem the balance on your Gift Card.
                            <br>
                            15. Greene King’s liability to you in relation to these Terms shall under no circumstances exceed the final balance held on your Gift Card.

                            17. Nothing in these Terms shall exclude Greene King’s liability for personal injury or death caused by its negligence.
                            <br>
                            18.
